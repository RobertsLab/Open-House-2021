We study shellfish in different ways, and one of the coolest ways is by studying their DNA ! From shellfish to people, all living things have DNA. Think about DNA like a cookbook: it contains all of the recipes, or genes , needed for living things to function everyday. For example, there are genes that influence the color of oyster shells, just like human genes that dictate our natural hair color! After a hatchery experiment, we can look at the DNA from oysters in different treatments to see how changes in the environment influence their genes! To do this, we need to collect DNA from the oysters. However, DNA is super tiny \u2014 you can\u2019t even see it with a microscope \u2014 and is hard to get to because it is inside of living things! Instead, we have to work in a laboratory and use a special process to get DNA called DNA isolation . The video below shows Sam, a Roberts Lab member, going through the process of isolating DNA from oysters. To start out, Sam makes sure that he has all of his materials ready on his lab bench: pipets, pipet tips, trays for holding tubes, blue mini pestles for smushing the oyster tissue in the tubes, centrifuge that spins the tubes really fast to help separate the DNA, tools for opening the oysters ( shucking ), special chemicals ( reagents ) that isolate the DNA, and gloves for safety! Sam begins by opening the oyster to remove the tissue that he wants to get the DNA from. He then uses a chemical called DNAzol that helps break down the tissue that holds the DNA. He uses a blue tiny pestle to mash up the tissue while it\u2019s in the liquid to make isolation even easier. He then uses different chemicals in a specific process to isolate the DNA! At the end, the oyster DNA is sitting in a little bit of water in the bottom of the tubes! Since we can\u2019t see DNA, how do we know how much we isolated? Sam takes the DNA over to a machine called a Nanodrop . This machine can tell us how much DNA we isolated! If we isolate enough DNA, we can use it to understand how different environments impact oyster genes!

(Part 1) How do we know how oysters respond to changes in their environment? In the hatchery, we can place oysters in different conditions, or treatments . During the experiment, we collect information, or data . These data range from measurements of oyster shells to tracking when larvae are released from adult oysters! We can compare data collected from oysters in different treatments to understand how oysters will respond to that change! In the activity below and the activity on the next tab, you\u2019ll see some of the data we\u2019ve collected from previous experiments, and try your hand at understanding it! Part 1: How do changes in water acidity affect larvae growth? Did you know the ocean is becoming more acidic because of climate change? When we talk about the ocean becoming more acidic, we say that the pH of the ocean decreases. Here in Washington, we\u2019re interested in knowing how pH impacts oyster larvae. This is because the shell building blocks that larvae use to build their shells \u2014 calcium carbonate \u2014 become less available to them as pH decreases! Image that shows cracks in an oyster larvae shell. In one of our experiments, Pacific oyster larvae were placed in different pH treatments. At the end of our experiment, we took two measurements of the larvae\u2019s shells: hinge length and shell depth (see image below). You can look at our data in the activity below! Click the treatment boxes to see what the shell measurements were for each group. The data for a pH group will pop up in different colors. Look at the length or depth on the horizontal, or x-axis , and the number of larvae on the vertical, or y-axis . Are some groups smaller than others? How do you think lower pH impacted shell measurements? You can also adjust the way the data is grouped together in the graphs by using the sliders to change the number of size bins. When you make the number of size bins larger, how does that change the graph? Is it easier to look at differences when there are more or less bins? Image of larval oysters under a microscope. The image is labeled with how the shell length (shell depth) and hinge length are measured.

Part 2: How do changes in water temperature and food impact larval release? Unlike the Pacific oyster, the Olympia oyster doesn\u2019t spawn eggs and sperm! Instead, sperm spawned and eggs are fertilized inside the mom oyster. Baby Olympia oysters grow inside the mom oyster, which is called brooding . After some time, the larvae are released from the mom into the water. In another experiment, we exposed adult Olympia oysters to different conditions to understand how it may impact larval release. There were two different temperatures (warm and cold), and two different food levels (high and low). Adult oysters were placed in four treatments: warm temperature and high food (dark blue), warm temperature and low food (red), cold temperature and high food (light blue), or cold temperatures and low food (light red).

Baby shellfish, or larvae , hatch from these eggs without shells! As time progresses, the oysters get bigger and grow their own shells. These larvae then become juveniles , or oyster seed or spat , when they settle onto the bottom surface. Juvenile oysters then grow into adults you may see in the wild or at a seafood market! Adults, which are referred to as broodstock in a hatchery, are monitored by hatchery workers who use a microscope to look at their gametes (eggs and sperm - see image below). By looking at these gametes , they can figure out if these adults have sperm or eggs. Image of eggs and sperm as seen from a microscope. These egg and sperm are from geoduck, but eggs and sperm are what hatchery workers look for in their adult oysters and geoduck. This geoduck has both eggs and sperm, which helps show the size difference between the two gametes! The eggs are the six large, round cells, and the sperm are the much smaller dots that are surrounding the eggs. The adults release their eggs or sperm into the water, which is called spawning . Once in the water, the eggs and sperm, or gametes , mix in the water and fertilize, creating new baby oysters! These babies are called larvae . Larvae are born without shells!
