# The Oyster Circle of Life

In the hatchery tour video, you learned some words like **broodstock**, **larvae**, **juvenile**, **spawning**, **oyster seed**, and **gametes**. These words are all related to the oyster life cycle. 


IMAGE OF LIFE CYCLE

The oyster life cycle. Adult oysters **spawn**, or release eggs and sperm into the water. These **gametes** mix in the water, creating fertilized eggs. Baby shellfish, or **larvae**, hatch from these eggs without shells! As time progresses, the oysters get bigger and grow their own shells. These **larvae** then become **juveniles**, or **oyster seed**, when they settle onto the bottom surface. **Juvenile** oysters then grow into adults you may see in the wild or at a seafood market!

Adults, which are referred to as **broodstock** in a hatchery, are monitored by hatchery workers who use a **microscope** to look at their **gametes** (eggs and sperm). By looking at these **gametes**, they can figure out if these adults have sperm or eggs.

Histo caption: 

The adults release their eggs or sperm into the water, which is called **spawning**. Once in the water, the eggs and sperm, or **gametes**, mix in the water and fertilize, creating new baby oysters! These babies are called **larvae**. **Larvae** are born without shells! The videos below show **larvae** after they have grown some of their shell.

This video is of two baby oysters. They both have tiny tentacle-like things coming out of their shells (called “cilia”) that help them move around.

This video is of baby oysters moving around. 

Remember seeing those green and brown tanks in the hatchery video? By eating green and brown **microalgae**, the **larvae** grow into **juveniles**. Unlike the **larvae**, **juveniles** live on the seafloor and don’t move on their own! In a hatchery, **juvenile** oysters can also be called **oyster seed**, because they are ready to grow into adults, much like seeds grow into plants!
