# Let's Play With Data!

How do we know how oysters respond to changes in their environment? In the hatchery, we can place oysters in different conditions, or **treatments**. During the experiment, we collect information, or **data**. These data range from measurements of oyster shells to tracking when larvae are released from adult oysters! We can compare data collected from oysters in different treatments to understand how oysters will respond to that change!

In the activity below and the activity on the next tab, you’ll see some of the data we’ve collected from previous experiments, and try your hand at understanding it!


## Part 1: How do changes in water acidity affect larvae growth?

Did you know the ocean is becoming more acidic because of climate change? When we talk about the ocean becoming more acidic, we say that the **pH** of the ocean decreases. Here in Washington, we’re interested in knowing how pH impacts oyster larvae. This is because the shell building blocks that larvae use to build their shells — **calcium carbonate** — become less available to them as pH decreases!
