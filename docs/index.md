# Welcome to the Roberts' Lab!

We study shellfish, like oysters and crabs, and how they respond to changes in the environment. To do this, we run experiments with these animals at different points in their lives! Click through the tabs on the left (PUT IN NEW TAB NAMES) to go through the steps we take to conduct our experiments, learn about shellfish, and play some fun games!
